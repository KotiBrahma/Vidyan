12. Allah —a contraction of the word al-Ilah or al-Ilāh (meaning “the god”) —contraction variations: Al-lāh and Allāh
The name “Allah” does not belong to Islam; it was used by Jews, Arabic peoples and Christians long BEFORE the existence of
Islam. The word “Allah” does not appear in the Hebrew or Greek Scriptures of the Old or New Testament, however neither does
the word “god.”
Compare to Hebrew el (god) and elah (or el ah) (meaning god) and eloah (god)
الله :Arabic
Aramaic transliteration: Elah and ʼĔlāhā (emphatic)
Almost all Western Christians avoid using this word for the Supreme Being, as, in their culture, it
is too strongly associated with Islam—and Christians and Muslims do not really worship the
same god and the two religions are radically different in many crucial ways. So, while the god of
Muslims is clearly a divergence from the One True God revealed in the Old and New Testament,
why do many Arab CHRISTIANS and some Jews continue to refer to God as “Allah”? Answer
